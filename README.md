# Zig tutorial by examples

This tutorial helps you to learn `Zig` in a quick and easy way. It targets the
following audiences:

- With a system programming language background (C/C++/Rust, etc) and want to
try `zig`

- Comes from a non-system programming language background and wants to give
it a try

</br>

I wrote this tutorial as a summary after I use `zig` to write a few projects
(including 2D gaming), so that's why you always see straightforward summarises
instead of amazing fancy words in this tutorial. 

Also, you can treat this tutorial as a quick `Q&A` or manual as well. That means
you don't need to go through from top to bottom, just click the chapter you're
interested in and dive in. In some chapters, I put extra links to other important
and valuable blogs/youtube/articles, just in case you want to know more about
that topic.

I'm working on some machine learning project with `zig` at this moment,  I will
update this tutorial from time to time, hope it helps:)
